# LOLSMITH Pack
A default edit that's highly modular and with a focus on PVP. Currently mainly for 1.7/1.8 but can be made compatible for post-1.9 updates.

### Notes
- The resourcepack will note that it's for a "newer version" **ignore this**.
- If you want to convert it to post-1.9 updates replace any folders with its *-newer* counterpart.
- Look at the **items_axetypes**, **items_bowtypes**, **items_fishingrodtypes**, and **items_swordtypes** for customization of items.
- Look at the **icon_variations** in *gui* for customization of icons.
- It's recommended that you copy over the files you want to use, and if you want to change them out for new ones or wipe the ones you're using, use the **resetitemsfolder** file for your files and **reseticonsfile** for your icons.
  - Note: the .cmd files only work for Windows and the .sh files only work for Linux.
