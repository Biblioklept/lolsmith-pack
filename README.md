# LOLSMITH Pack

A default edit that's highly modular and with a focus on PVP. Currently mainly for 1.7/1.8 but can be made compatible for post-1.9 updates.

If you want to convert it replace any folders with its `-newer` counterpart.

It's recommended you look at the `items_swordtypes` and `items_bowtypes`.

Download by clicking on the `Code` button and clicking `Download ZIP`.
